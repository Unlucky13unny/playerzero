  <h2>FAQs</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>What is the PlayerZero Challenge?</summary>
    <p>This is a community competition for Pokémon GO players. It’s not affiliated with any game publisher — just a grind-it-out contest for bragging rights, stats, and prizes.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
  <summary>Who’s behind the PlayerZero Challenge?</summary>
  <p>The challenge is backed by <a href="https://unluckybunny.com" target="_blank" style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Unlucky Bunny</a> — an independent creative brand focused on building unique, community-first experiences. From underground competitions to bizarre street marketing, Unlucky Bunny thrives on blending chaos with competition. PlayerZero is their latest experiment in that mission.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How do I join?</summary>
    <p>Submit your Trainer Code, stats, and screenshots through the entry form and pay the entry fee to lock in your spot.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>When does the challenge start?</summary>
    <p>Once we hit the minimum number of players to fund the base prize pool, we'll set a launch date. You’ll be notified well in advance so you have time to prepare and plan your grind.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What stats count?</summary>
    <p>This challenge is all about the grind — tracked through quantifiable stats like XP gain, Pokémon caught, distance walked, and PokéStops visited. Final categories and scoring methods will be shared before the challenge begins and may shift based on participation.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What do I win?</summary>
    <p>All prizes will be awarded in PokéCoins, including end-of-challenge rewards for top scorers and bonus drops from social media challenges. The more players who enter, the bigger the prize pool — and the more winners we’ll be able to reward in each tier.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How many winners will there be?</summary>
    <p>The number of winners scales with the community. At minimum, we aim to award prizes to the top 3 overall performers, the top 5 in each tracked stat, and 2–5 daily winners through social media challenges. The bigger the event, the bigger the prize pool — and the more players we can reward. Our goal is to recognize both consistency and creativity across the entire challenge.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>How are winners notified?</summary>
  <p>
    We'll contact winners via the email submitted on your entry form.
    You can also follow us on
    Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/pgPlayerZero" target="_blank" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>@pgPlayerZero</strong></a>

    TikTok <a href="https://tiktok.com/@pgPlayerZero" target="_blank" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>@pgPlayerZero</strong></a>

  </p>
</details>



  <details>
    <summary>What if I miss the start?</summary>
    <p>The challenge runs for a full 7 days. You can join late and still submit both your starting and ending stats. Just make sure you complete both submission forms before the deadline!</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will player level be a scoring factor?</summary>
    <p>No. All scoring metrics are chosen to level the playing field. Whether you’re a new or veteran trainer, the categories are designed to reward hustle — not legacy advantage.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What prevents cheating?</summary>
    <p>We require screenshots before and after the challenge. These are scanned using image verification tools and reviewed manually. We also have unique Buddy Pokémon name verification to confirm identity across submissions. Any suspicious or manipulated images will result in disqualification — no refunds.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this an official Pokémon GO event?</summary>
    <p>Nope. The PlayerZero Challenge is an independent, community-run competition. It’s not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Pokémon, Nintendo, Niantic, or any of their partners. We’re just fans who like to compete and create something fun for other players.</p>
