    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is the PlayerZero Challenge?</summary>
      <p>A community competition for Pokémon Go players to flex their grind — XP, catches, distance walked, and more. Not affiliated with Niantic, just a celebration of hustle and bragging rights.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I join?</summary>
      <p>Click “Enter Now,” pay the entry fee, and upload your Trainer Code screenshot. This becomes your Player ID and must stay consistent throughout the challenge.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>When does the challenge start?</summary>
      <p>Once the minimum number of players join, we’ll announce an official start date — at least 30 days out. This gives everyone time to prep and spread the word.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How long is the challenge?</summary>
      <p>Each event lasts 7 days. You can submit your starting data anytime before the deadline. Even if you join a day or two late, you can still compete.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What stats count?</summary>
      <p>This challenge is all about the grind — tracked through quantifiable stats like XP gain, Pokémon caught, and more. Scoring categories may shift based on participation, and could include weighted totals or individual standouts. Final rules will be announced prior to launch.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What can I win?</summary>
      <p>Cash prizes for top performers and daily drops for social media standouts. Prize pools grow as more players join — unlocking additional winners and bigger payouts.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Will player level be a category?</summary>
      <p>Nope. Every player starts with a clean slate. It’s not about how far you've come — it’s about what you can do in 7 days.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What prevents cheating?</summary>
      <p>We require screenshots, use AI to read and verify stat changes, and check for inconsistencies. If your images are edited or shady, you’re disqualified with no refund. Don’t be that person.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How will I know if I win?</summary>
      <p>We’ll contact winners using the email provided during entry. You can also follow @pgPlayerZero on Instagram for announcements and rankings.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Where does my entry fee go?</summary>
      <p>100% goes into running the challenge and funding the prize pool. The more entries we receive, the more we give back to players.</p>
