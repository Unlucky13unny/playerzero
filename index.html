    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What is the PlayerZero Challenge?</summary>
      <p>A competition built for the grind. Compete using in-game Pokémon GO stats and social media challenges. It’s not affiliated with Niantic — just bragging rights, cash, and community pride.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I join?</summary>
      <p>Click “Enter Now,” pay the fee, and upload your Trainer Code screen. That code becomes your PlayerZero ID — used to verify your performance throughout the week-long event.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>When does the challenge start?</summary>
      <p>Once the minimum participant tier is reached, we’ll set a launch date — with plenty of advance notice (typically 30+ days) to plan, train, and hype it up. We want this to be huge, not just minimum.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What stats count?</summary>
      <p>This challenge is all about the grind — tracked through quantifiable stats like XP gain, Pokémon caught, and more. The final categories may vary depending on participation and could include weighted scoring or single-stat formats. Full scoring rules will be posted before the event begins.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Does player level matter?</summary>
      <p>Nope. Whether you’re a level 12 newbie or level 50 vet, scoring is based on your week’s hustle — not lifetime stats. Everyone starts on equal footing.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What do I win?</summary>
      <p>Cash for top performers. Bonus prizes for social media challenges. Prize tiers scale with participation — more players = more winners and bigger payouts.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What does the entry fee go toward?</summary>
      <p>Everything goes back into the challenge — covering costs, prize money, tools, and community support.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What if I miss the start?</summary>
      <p>You can still play! The challenge runs for 7 days, and your starting stats can be submitted anytime during the event window. Just make sure both start and end stats are uploaded to qualify.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I know if I won?</summary>
      <p>Winners will be contacted via the email you submit at signup. You can also follow updates and leaderboard info on Instagram at <strong>@pgPlayerZero</strong>.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I cheat?</summary>
      <p>Nope. All entries are reviewed using AI tools and human moderation. Any altered images, suspicious data, or funny business = disqualified with no refund. Keep it fair, or don’t bother.</p>
